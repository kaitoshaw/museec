# Music Recommender System
This repository is dedicated to University of Nottingham - Individual Dissertation project. This project was inspired by the recommendation system algorithm used by big companies such as Spotify, Joox, and many others to look for similar songs based on listening activity.

The main goal of this project is to see the factors that may increase the performance of the music recommendation algorithms.
